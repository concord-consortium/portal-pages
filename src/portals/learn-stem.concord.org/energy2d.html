    <h1>Energy2D</h1>
    <p>Energy2D is an interactive, visual multiphysics simulation program that models all three modes of heat
      transferâ€”conduction, convection, and radiation, and their coupling with particle dynamics. Energy2D runs
      very quickly on most computers and eliminates the switches among preprocessors, solvers, and
      postprocessors typically needed to perform computational fluid dynamics simulations. It allows you to
      design "computational experiments" to test a scientific hypothesis or solve an engineering problem
      without resorting to complex mathematics.</p>
