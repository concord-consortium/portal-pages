      <p>Students should learn science by doing science. They should select their own question, design and execute a study, draw conclusions based on their data, and communicate their findings. InquirySpace provides ideas, approaches, and technologies to make this approach to learning easier for classroom teachers to offer—and more effective. </p><p><a class="button" style="clear: both !important; display: block; float: left; font: 300 1.25em museo-slab, georgia, times, 'times new roman', serif; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 10px 20px !important;" href="http://learn.concord.org/" onclick="Portal.openSignupModal();return false;">Register Now</a></p><p style="clear: both;">Want to learn more about the project and its research?
