<p>We used Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles to create practical science materials for students and teachers in inclusive classrooms. These inquiry activities center around the theme of energy and address questions such as “Why are there clouds?“ and “What do plants eat?“ Probes and sensors support lab investigations, and computational models allow students to explore virtual environments. Graphing software expresses data and relationships in text and spoken form. The software can recognize patterns that experts see in the graphs and scaffold student investigations into the graphs.</p>
