    <h1>Next-Generation Molecular Workbench</h1>
    <p>Molecular Workbench (MW) is powerful, award-winning software that provides visual, interactive computational experiments for teaching and learning science. Thanks to Google's generosity and the power of HTML5, we're bringing this versatile way to experience the science of atoms and molecules to Web browsers.</p>
    <p>We've created many molecular models that dynamically illustrate scientific concepts and allow you to interact with molecules or macroscopic phenomena like pendulums and their environment in various ways. Next-Generation Molecular Workbench activities include one or more interactives, plus text, embedded images, video, and assessments.</p>
