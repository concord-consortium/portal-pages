    <p>IPUMS Terra has partnered with Concord Consortium to provide sample data for classroom instruction via Concordâ€™s <a href="https://codap.concord.org/" target="_blank">Common Online Data Analysis Platform</a> (CODAP) application. CODAP provides a drag-and-drop web-based interface for secondary students to explore, visualize, and analyze real-world data.</p>
    <p>IPUMS Terra data are free of charge and cover a wide range of population and environmental topics. Population data are from U.S. and international censuses, and cover demographics, education, employment, income, housing and other areas. Environmental data include land cover, agricultural land use, and climate. </p>
    <p>Educators and students may also use <a href="https://data.terrapop.org/terrascope" target="_blank">TerraScope</a> to create their own datasets, which incorporate international aggregate data and environmental data.</p>
    <h2>Educational Standards:</h2>
    <p>Lessons incorporating CODAP and IPUMS Terra data can be designed to satisfy a wide range of educational standards. The data and sample lesson plans contain material for a range of curricula.
