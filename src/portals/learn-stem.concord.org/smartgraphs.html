    <h1>SmartGraphs</h1>
    <p>Our SmartGraphs software provides scaffolds and hints to students who need help understanding a graph. These visual and textual hints make our SmartGraphs activities smart! Activities run in a modern Web browser using HTML5. Most SmartGraphs activities also run on tablet computers, like the iPad.<a href="#tablet-note">*</a></p>
    <p>In several activities, students draw prediction graphs with a mouse and compare them to data collected by a motion sensor and displayed in the browser. They label portions of a graph and calculate the speed of objects based on graphical and tabular representations of data. Students can watch graphs being constructed as the image of a moving car generates position-time and velocity-time graphs, for example. And when students answer embedded questions incorrectly, SmartGraphs provides visual hints, text hints, and arithmetic hints to help them understand the graphs and the underlying concepts (like velocity) represented in the graphs.</p>
