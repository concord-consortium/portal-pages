    <h1>VISUAL</h1>
    <p>Dynamic visualizations — which we define as interactive, computer-based animations of scientific phenomena — provide an alternative pathway for students to learn science concepts through exploration. Visualizations make unseen processes like chemical reactions or planetary motion visible. They allow students to conduct virtual experiments about complex situations. Visualizing to Integrate Science Understanding for All Learners (VISUAL) investigated promising visualizations to determine how and when they improve science learning.</p>
