    <p class="portal-pages-byline"><img style="float:right" src="https://building-models-resources.concord.org/CREATE-logo.png"><a href="http://create4stem.msu.edu/" title="CREATE for STEM Institute" target="_blank">A collaboration between the CREATE for STEM Institute at Michigan State University and the Concord Consortium.</a></p>
    <p>This set of simulations is used in the <a href="https://create4stem.msu.edu/sites/default/files/pages/HIOH%20What%20Controls%20My%20Health%3F%20CURRICULUM010818.pdf" target="_blank">Health in Our Hands curriculum</a> (HiOH) to study how environmental and genetic factors influence the growth of organisms. The simulations can also be used independently from the curriculum to investigate gene-environment interactions.</p>
    <h2>The Curriculum</h2>
    <p>HiOH consists of two 10-12-week project-based middle school science curricula designed to meet the Next Generations Science Standards. In “What controls my health?” students investigate type 2 diabetes, which connects them to real-world experiences and provides relevance for their learning. Throughout the unit,  students figure out how lifestyle options for healthy food choices and exercise can help prevent or reduce diabetes. In “How can looking for thrills make me miserable?” students study the biology of addiction. They investigate the brain’s reward system and why this system is important to our survival but can lead to addictive behavior. Throughout the unit they discuss addiction more broadly, and develop an understanding of how our genetics and the environment put us at risk. In both units, students conduct an action research project in their school or neighborhood to help prevent or reduce diabetes and addiction.</p>
    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>The CREATE for STEM Institute at Michigan State University has collaborated with the Concord Consortium and other partners on <strong><em>Health in Our Hands</em></strong>.

      <div class="collapsible">
        <p>These simulations along with the HiOH curriculum moves students towards achieving the following Next Generation Science Standards.</p>
        <p><strong>MS-LS1-5.</strong> Construct a scientific explanation based on
        evidence for how environmental and genetic factors influence the growth of
        organisms.</p>
        <p><strong>MS-LS3-2.</strong> Develop and use a model to describe why
        asexual reproduction results in offspring with identical genetic
        information and sexual reproduction results in offspring with genetic
        variation.</p>
        <p><strong>MS-LS4-4.</strong> Construct an explanation based on evidence
        that describes how genetic variations of traits in a population increase
        some individuals' probability of surviving and reproducing in a specific
        environment.</p>
        <p><strong>MS-LS4-6.</strong> Use mathematical representations to support
        explanations of how natural selection may lead to increases and decreases
        of specific traits in populations over time.</p>
        <p><strong>MS-LS1-4.</strong> Use argument based on empirical evidence and
        scientific reasoning to support an explanation for how characteristic
        animal behaviors and specialized plant structures affect the probability
        of successful reproduction of animals and plants respectively.</p>
