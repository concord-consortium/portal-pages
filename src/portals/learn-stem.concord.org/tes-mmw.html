    <h1>Teaching Environmental Sustainability: MMW</h1>
    <p>Teaching Environmental Sustainability: Model My Watershed is promoting geospatial literacy and systems thinking by providing students and teachers with access to scientifically valid and easy-to-use watershed tools to accurately examine their own neighborhoods, to define local environmental problems or challenges, and to develop solutions to improve their environment. Instructional materials include a new GIS-based web application to analyze real data on environmental impacts related to land use, water quantity/quality, and local socioeconomic impacts.</p>
