<p>The Science of Atoms and Molecules  was designed to assist the realignment of high school science disciplines into a physics, chemistry, and biology sequence. SAM activities provide critical atomic-scale science content that can enable and take advantage of the revised sequence. The atomic and molecular model-based activities facilitate not only the disciplinary order but also four thematic sequences: Motion and Energy, Charge, Atoms and Molecules, and Light.</p>
