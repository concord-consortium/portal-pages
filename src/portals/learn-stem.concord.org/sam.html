    <h1>Science of Atoms and Molecules / RI-ITEST </h1>
<p>Thank you for your interest in RI-ITEST. As of June 25, RI-ITEST materials will be moved here to our STEM Resource Finder.
What does this mean for you? Creating a free account on our STEM Resource Finder means you can continue to use the Java-based RI-ITEST materials. However, the reporting of student results for these activities will no longer be supported. (Note that some of these materials include a report button that allows students to print a report of their work, but their results are not saved.) If you have questions, please contact us at help@concord.org. </p>
<p>The Science of Atoms and Molecules  was designed to assist the realignment of high school science disciplines into a physics, chemistry, and biology sequence. SAM activities provide critical atomic-scale science content that can enable and take advantage of the revised sequence. The atomic and molecular model-based activities facilitate not only the disciplinary order but also four thematic sequences: Motion and Energy, Charge, Atoms and Molecules, and Light.</p>
