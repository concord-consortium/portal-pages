<p>The interactions of electrons with matter have great explanatory power and are central to many technologies from transistors, diodes, smoke detectors, and dosemeters to sophisticated imaging, lasers, and quantum computing. A conceptual understanding of the interactions of electrons in general allow students to acquire conceptual understandings that they can apply to a very broad range of technologies.</p>
<p>The Electron Technologies project developed field-tested interactive activities addressing core content and technical applications such as nanotechnology, photonics, electronics, materials science, biotechnology, and chemical engineering. </p>
