    <h1>Electron Technologies</h1>
    <p>The interactions of electrons with matter have great explanatory power and are
      central to many technologies from transistors, diodes, smoke detectors, and dosemeters
      to sophisticated imaging, lasers, and quantum computing. A conceptual understanding of
      the interactions of electrons in general allow students to acquire conceptual
      understandings that they can apply to a very broad range of technologies.</p>
    <p>The Electron Technologies project developed field-tested interactive activities
      addressing core content and technical applications such as nanotechnology, photonics,
      electronics, materials science, biotechnology, and chemical engineering.</p>
