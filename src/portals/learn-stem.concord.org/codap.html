    <h1>Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP)</h1>
    <p>Data are everywhere! CODAP provides an easy-to-use web-based data analysis platform, geared toward middle and high school students, and aimed at teachers and curriculum developers. CODAP can be incorporated across the curriculum to help students summarize, visualize and interpret data, advancing their skills to use data as evidence to support a claim. Just as language and numeric literacy involve understanding the world through words and mathematical constructs, data literacy involves understanding the world through data exploration. Todayâ€™s middle and high school students need to work with data in order to advance their skills and prepare for the burgeoning careers and inquiry-based practices of data scientists.</p>
