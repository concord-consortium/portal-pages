    <h1>Energy3D</h1>
    <p>Energy3D is a simulation-based engineering tool for designing green buildings and power stations
      that harness renewable energy to achieve sustainable development. Users can quickly sketch up a
      realistic-looking structure or import one from an existing CAD file (*.dae), superimpose it on a
      map image (e.g., Google Maps or lot maps), and then evaluate its energy performance for any given
      day and location. Based on computational physics and weather data, Energy3D can rapidly generate
      time graphs (resembling data loggers) and heat maps (resembling infrared cameras) for in-depth
      analyses. At the end of the design, Energy3D allows users to print it out, cut out the pieces, and
      use them to assemble a physical scale model. Energy3D has been primarily developed to provide a
      simulated environment for engineering design (SEED) to support science and engineering education
      and training. As its simulation results are accurate and its user interfaces are friendly, it may
      also be used as an entry-level energy simulation tool for professionals.</p>
