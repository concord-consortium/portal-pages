    <h1>Dynamic Data Science</h1>
    <p>The age of data is upon us! Complex datasets underpin nearly every aspect of modern life, demanding data fluency by all students. This set of dynamic data science activities is designed for grades 9-14. By working with data frequently and repeatedly, learners develop experience and competence, gaining fluency with the data moves necessary for structuring, examining, and diving into data, and ultimately building excitement for their ability to work with data.</p>
    <p>All dynamic data science activities are embedded in our <a href="http://codap.concord.org">Common Online Data Analysis Platform</a> (CODAP) software, and follow a similar design: students make context-specific actions, store their data, organize it, analyze it, and visualize it in the surrounding CODAP environment. These activities were made possible through our National Science Foundation-funded <a href="https://concord.org/our-work/research-projects/data-science-games/" title="The Data Science Games Project - Win games by visualizing data, improving strategy, and leveling up">Data Science Games project</a>, and are aligned to Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and Common Core Standards.</p>
