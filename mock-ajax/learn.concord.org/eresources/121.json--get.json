  "description": "<p><a href=\"#?subject_areas=Biology&amp;grade_levels=9-12,Higher+Ed&amp;no_save=true\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>Explore the relationship between the genetic code on the DNA strand and the resulting protein and rudimentary shape it forms. Through models of transcription and translation, you will discover this relationship and the resilience to mutations built into our genetic code. Start by exploring DNA's double helix with an interactive 3D model. Highlight base pairs, look at one or both strands, and turn hydrogen bonds on or off. Next, watch an animation of transcription, which creates RNA from DNA, and translation, which ‚Äúreads‚Äú the RNA codons to create a protein. Finally, make mutations to DNA and see the effects on the proteins that result. Learn why some mutations change the resulting protein while other mutations are \"silent.\"</p>\r\n<p>» <a href=\"http://ri-itest.concord.org/SAMActivities/teacherGuides/biology/Teacher%20Guide%20DNA%20to%20Protein.ver8.pdf\">Teacher Guide</a></p>\r\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>This activity can be assigned, but student responses will not be saved.",
