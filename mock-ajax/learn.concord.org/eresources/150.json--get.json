A Virtual Field model has light levels that vary smoothly from top to bottom. A single type of seed grows best in the center of the field, but the model includes variation in the offspring seeds. Since each plant scatters seeds randomly, it happens occasionally that some of these different seeds fall in a location where the light level is just right for it. When this happens the seed will grow into a healthy plant that will produce seeds of its own. In this way, the single type of plant eventually evolves into a full spectrum of different varieties. (Evolution Readiness Activity 3 of 10.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Â» <a href=\"http://concord.org/sites/default/files/projects/er/materials/TeacherGuide_Activity3-TXMO-final.pdf\">Teacher Guide</a></p>\r\n\r\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>This activity can be assigned, but student responses will not be saved.",
