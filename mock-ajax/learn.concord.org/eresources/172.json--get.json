  "description": "<p><a href=\"#?subject_areas=Physics&amp;grade_levels=9-12,Higher+Ed&amp;no_save=true\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>Transistors are the building blocks of modern electronic devices. Your cell phones, iPods, and computers all depend on them to operate. Thanks to today's microfabrication technology, transistors can be made very tiny and be massively produced. You are probably using billions of them while working with this activity now--as of 2006, a dual-core Intel microprocessor contains 1.7 billion transistors. <strong>The field effect transistor</strong> is the most common type of transistor. So we will focus on it in this activity.What exactly does a field effect transistor do? The answer is that it can be used as a switch to control electric current.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> This activity can be assigned, but student responses will not be saved.",
