This activity focuses on potential energy and kinetic energy as well as energy conservation. The goal is to apply what is learned to both our human scale world and the world of atoms and molecules.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Students will be able to:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Differentiate between kinetic and potential energy</li>\r\n<li>Explain how kinetic energy can be converted to potential energy and vice versa</li>\r\n<li>Analyze energy graphs and the motion of objects in a system to learn about the Law of Conservation of Energy</li>\r\n<li>Apply the First Law of Thermodynamics when heating or cooling a system</li>\r\n<li>Differentiate between energy transfer in an open system and energy conversion</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>This activity can be assigned, but student responses will not be saved.",
