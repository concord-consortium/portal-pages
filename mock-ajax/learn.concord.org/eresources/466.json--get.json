Students start by defining potential energy as energy that is stored in a system of interacting objects. Students then explore the relationship between potential energy and fields in order to explain how objects interact without touching. Finally, students evaluate factors that affect the amount of potential energy stored in a system. This investigation builds toward NGSS PEs: MS-PS3-2 and HS-PS3-5.",
