Learn about the effects positive and negative charges have on one another, and investigate these effects further through games. Learn about Coulomb's law and the concept that both the distance between the charges and the difference in the charges affect the strength of the force. Explore polarization at an atomic level, and learn how a material that does not hold any net charge can be attracted to a charged object.</p>\r\n<p>Â» <a href=\"http://ri-itest.concord.org/SAMActivities/teacherGuides/physics/electrostatics.ver11.pdf\">Teacher Guide</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Students will be able to:</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explain how a neutral atom can become a charged particle, an ion</li>\r\n<li>Define Coulomb forces as a result of like charges repelling each other and unlike charges attracting</li>\r\n<li>Determine that the force generated between atoms is dependent on the amount of charge they carry and the distance between them\r\n<li>Explore the mathematical relationship described in Coulomb equations</li>\r\n<li>Explain polarization in terms of charge redistribution</li>\r\n<li>Give an example of how screening is at work in a biological system, such as a cell</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>This activity can be assigned, but student responses will not be saved.",
