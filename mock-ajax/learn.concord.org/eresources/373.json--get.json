Answer questions regarding voltage drops across resistors and currents through them in such circuits. Practice calculating the effective resistances of a set of resistances in series and parallel. Using an interactive simulation of circuits and a digital multimeter, you are challenged to measure voltage drops and currents, including in those situations in which the actual resistance is not precisely what the color coding of the resistor would suggest, and to compare your measured values to your calculated ones.\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>This activity can be assigned, but student responses will not be saved.</p>",
