Some of them are small, made from only a few atoms. There is, however, a special class of molecules that make up and play critical roles in living cells. These molecules can consist of many thousands to millions of atoms. They are referred to as macromolecules (or large biomolecules).In this activity, you will \"zoom\" down from living things we can see with our own eyes to the macromolecules and the smaller molecules from which they are made. In the process, you will learn about the molecular structure of these macromolecules and where examples of these molecules are located in cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> This activity can be assigned, but student responses will not be saved.",
