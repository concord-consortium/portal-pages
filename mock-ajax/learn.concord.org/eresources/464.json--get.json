Students learn that a chemical reaction is a process that involves the atoms of substances rearranging to form new substances and that to start any chemical reaction, energy is needed to break bonds in the reactants. Students will compare reactions and changes in energy. Students develop several models to describe observations of reactions. This investigation builds toward NGSS PEs: HS-PS1-4, HS-PS1-5 and HS-PS3-2.",
