Students experiment with changing the temperature and the concentration of the atoms in order to see how these affect reaction rates. They also learn how to communicate what happens during a chemical reaction by writing the ratios of reactants and products, known as stoichiometry.</p>\r\n<p>Â» <a href=\"http://ri-itest.concord.org/SAMActivities/teacherGuides/chemsitry/chemical_reactions.ver11.pdf\">Teacher Guide</a></p>\r\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>This activity can be assigned, but student responses will not be saved.",
