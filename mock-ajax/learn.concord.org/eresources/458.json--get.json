  "abstract": "<a href=\"#?subject_areas=Chemistry,Physics&amp;grade_levels=9-12&amp;browser_based=true\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>In this investigation, students will develop a conceptual model of electrostatic interactions by exploring how various charged objects (Scotch tape, balloons, rods of various materials, and a Van de Graaff generator) interact with each other and with uncharged objects (paper, water bottle, a hand). By the end of the investigation, the student model will include positive and negative charges as well as patterns that can be used to explain and predict how charged objects interact. This investigation builds toward NGSS PE: HS-PS2-4.\r\n",
