  "description": "<p><a href=\"#?subject_areas=Physics,Engineering&amp;grade_levels=9-12,Higher+Ed&amp;browser_based=true&amp;no_save=true\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>This interactive simulation introduces circuits with resistors in parallel and presents you with questions regarding voltage drops across resistors and currents through them in such circuits. It also covers the calculation of the effective resistances of a set of resistances in parallel. Use a digital multimeter to measure voltage drops and currents, including those situations in which the actual resistance is not precisely what the color coding of the resistor would suggest, and compare your measured values to your calculated ones.\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>This activity can be assigned, but student responses will not be saved.</p>",
