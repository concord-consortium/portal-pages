They start with an exploration of the differences between small molecules and macromolecules such as proteins. They use cartoon representations to build \"protein complexes\" in a model and test the effects of shape and temperature on the strength of the fit. Students review polar and non-polar molecules and identify polar and non-polar regions of a given protein. Finally, students are challenged to find the best fit for a particular receptor based on shape and charges.</p>\r\n<p>Â» <a href=\"http://ri-itest.concord.org/SAMActivities/teacherGuides/biology/TG_ProteinPartners-ver10.pdf\">Teacher Guide</a></p>\r\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>This activity can be assigned, but student responses will not be saved.",
