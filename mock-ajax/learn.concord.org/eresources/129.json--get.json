They vary the volume of a container at constant temperature to see how pressure changes (Boyle's Law), change the temperature of a container at constant pressure to see how the volume changes with temperature (Charles's Law), and experiment with heating a gas in a closed container to discover how pressure changes with temperature (Gay Lussac's Law). They also discover the relationship between the number of gas molecules and gas volume (Avogadro's Law). Finally, students use their knowledge of gas laws to model a heated soda can collapsing as it is plunged into ice water.</p>\r\n<p>Â» <a href=\"http://ri-itest.concord.org/SAMActivities/teacherGuides/chemsitry/gas_laws.ver10.pdf\">Teacher Guide</a></p>\r\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>This activity can be assigned, but student responses will not be saved.",
