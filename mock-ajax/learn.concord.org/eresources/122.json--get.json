Start at an atomic level and use interactive models to investigate how temperature can affect conductivity and resistivity in a substance by monitoring a virtual ammeter. Explore how factors such as resistivity and voltage affect the flow of electrons and learn about Ohm's law.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Students will be able to:</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> Explain how voltage is the driving force behind electron movement</li>\r\n<li>Define electric current as the number of electrons flowing through a wire over a given period of time</li>\r\n<li>Explain how conductivity and resistivity relate to electric currentInfer the relationships between current, voltage, and resistance as described in Ohm's Law (I = V / R)</li>\r\n<li>Explain how electricity can be converted to other forms of energy</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>This activity can be assigned, but student responses will not be saved.",
