Students will explore various simulations to build their understanding of the relationships among electric forces, energy, and the relative distance of two atoms. They will also explain the energy transfers that occur when molecules form and break using the concept of conservation of energy (developed in previous investigations). This investigation builds towards NGSS PEs MS-PS1-1 and HS-PS1-4.",
