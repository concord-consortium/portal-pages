In addition, they will explore the forces involved in maintaining an atomâ€™s structure and the effect that introduction into an electric field has on electron distribution. Students will extend their conceptual model of electrostatic interactions to include 1) electron transfer as the mechanism for how an object becomes charged and 2) shifting electron distribution to explain how neutral objects can be attracted to both positively and negatively charged objects. This investigation helps build toward NGSS PE(s): HS-PS1-1 and HS-PS1-3.",
