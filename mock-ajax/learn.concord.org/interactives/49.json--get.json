A spring is a resilient device that can be pressed or pulled but return to its original shape when released. Springs are commonly helical coiled metal devices. When a spring is compressed or stretched and then released, it will vibrate at a particular frequency. This frequency is called the period of the spring. Experiment by changing the spring constant (a measure of the elasticity of the coils), the mass of the weight at the end of the spring, the initial extension or compression of the spring or the friction (or damping force) exerted on the spring. Which of these factors affect the period of the spring?",
