While all molecules are attracted to each other, some attractions are stronger than others. Non-polar molecules are attracted through a London dispersion attraction; polar molecules are attracted through both the London dispersion force and the stronger dipole-dipole attraction. The force of attractions between molecules has consequences for their interactions in physical, chemical and biological applications.\r\n\r\nThis simulation was developed for the <a href=\"http://teachchemistry.org/\">American Association of Chemistry Teachers</a> (AACT), an organization that supports K-12 teachers of chemistry. AACT produced the <a href=\"http://concord.org/sites/default/files/projects/interactions/Teacher-Guide-AACT.pdf\">teacher guide</a>, <a href=\"http://concord.org/sites/default/files/projects/interactions/Student-Activity-AACT.pdf\">student activity</a> and <a href=\"http://concord.org/sites/default/files/projects/interactions/Answer-Key-AACT.pdf\">answer key</a> to accompany the simulation.",
