While all molecules are attracted to each other, some attractions are stronger than others. Non-polar molecules are attracted through a London dispersion attraction; polar molecules are attracted through both the London dispersion force and the stronger dipole-dipole attraction. The dipole-dipole attraction is often thought of as \"opposite charges attract; like charges repel.\" The force of attractions between molecules has consequences for their interactions in physical, chemical and biological applications.</p>",
