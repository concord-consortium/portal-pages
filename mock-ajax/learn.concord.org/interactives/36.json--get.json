Molecules are always in motion. Molecules in a gas move quickly. All molecules are attracted to each other. Molecules can be weakly or strongly attracted to each other. The way that large molecules interact in physical, chemical and biological applications is a direct consequence of the many tiny attractions of the smaller parts.</p>",
