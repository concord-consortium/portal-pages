Diffusion is the process of a substance spreading out from its origin. Molecules diffuse through random molecular motion. Diffusion is always happening, even when a system appears to have reached equilibrium, because molecules are always moving. Cells are selectively permeable, meaning that their membranes allow some substances to cross easily while others are unable to cross without assistance. Cell membranes are selectively permeable, in part because its pores are small, allowing the cell to prevent larger molecules from moving across the membrane.</p>",
