Diffusion is the process of a substance spreading out from its origin. Molecules diffuse through random molecular motion. Diffusion is always happening, even when a system appears to have reached equilibrium, because molecules are always moving. Massive molecules have more kinetic energy than less massive molecules at the same temperature.</p>",
