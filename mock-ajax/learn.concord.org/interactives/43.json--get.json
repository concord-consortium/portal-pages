A pendulum is a weight hung from a fixed point. Pendulums swing back and forth in a regular motion known as a period. The period of a pendulum is affected by the length of the string/rod. A spring is a resilient device that can be pressed or pulled but return to its original shape when released. Springs are commonly helical coiled metal devices. When a spring is compressed or stretched and then released, it will vibrate at a particular frequency. This frequency is called the period of the spring. The period of a spring is affected by the spring constant (a measure of the elasticity of the coils). How does a pendulum behave when the length of the spring that suspends the mass is constantly changing?",
