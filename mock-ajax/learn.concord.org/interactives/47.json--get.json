Proteins, made up of amino acids, are used for many different purposes in the cell. The cell is an aqueous (water-filled) environment. Some amino acids have polar (hydrophilic) side chains while others have non-polar (hydrophobic) side chains. The hydrophilic amino acids interact more strongly with water (which is polar) than do the hydrophobic amino acids. The interactions of the amino acids within the aqueous environment result in a specific protein shape.</p>",
