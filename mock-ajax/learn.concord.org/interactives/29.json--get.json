Despite the ‚Äúbond‚Äù name, hydrogen bonds are a special type of dipole-dipole interaction. Hydrogen bonds between two molecules (or within portions of a larger molecule) when hydrogen atoms bonded to highly electronegative atoms (such as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine) interact with electronegative portions of a different molecule or within the same molecule. Hydrogen bonds are particularly important in stabilizing large macromolecules, such as proteins and DNA.</p>",
