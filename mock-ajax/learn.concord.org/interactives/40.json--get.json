Oil is a non-polar molecule, while water is a polar molecule. While all molecules are attracted to each other, some attractions are stronger than others. Non-polar molecules are attracted through a London dispersion attraction; polar molecules are attracted through both the London dispersion force and the stronger dipole-dipole attraction. When oil and water are mixed, the dipole-dipole interactions are disrupted, but constant molecular motion allows the stronger dipole-dipole attractions to partition the polar molecules from the mixture. The force of attractions between molecules has consequences for their interactions in physical, chemical and biological applications.</p>",
