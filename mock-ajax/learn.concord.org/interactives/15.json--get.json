Convection refers to the transfer of heat by a fluid material (such as air or water) moving from one place to another. Warm air is less dense than cold air, so it rises and cold air sinks. This is called natural convection. Air is constantly circulating indoors and outdoors, moving heat from one place to another. With this model you can compare how conduction and convection transfer heat.",
