While all molecules are attracted to each other, some attractions are stronger than others. Non-polar molecules are attracted through a London dispersion attraction; the strength of the attraction depends on the shapes and sizes of the interacting molecules. The force of attractions between molecules has consequences for their interactions in physical, chemical and biological applications.</p>",
